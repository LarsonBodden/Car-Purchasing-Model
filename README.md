## Model
R2 Score Model 

R2 score is 99%.
Accuracy: 99.94 %
Standard Deviation: 0.01 %
Here the Standard deviation is very low which assures that the linear regression model is the best fit for our data.

## Recommendations:

R2 score model perfomed based across all models deeming it the best production model. It performed at an accurary of 99% vs 96% and 86%. The company should focus on older population with Higher Annual salary.
