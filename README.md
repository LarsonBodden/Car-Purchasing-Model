## Model

Our random forest performed the same as the train data. It can predict 100% of our training data.


## Recommendations:

I would recomend our random forest model as it performed better on the r2 score with no tuning compared to our linear model which was also un-tuned. Our random forest was able to predict 100% of the training data.
